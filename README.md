# BookShorts
A web app to save your own book summaries. Add, view, and delete summaries anytime — all saved in your browser.
# 📚 BookShorts

BookShorts is a browser-based web app that lets users **store their own book summaries**.  
Each summary includes a title, author, and a short description. Data is saved in **LocalStorage**, so summaries remain even after refresh or shutdown — without any backend.
