            <h2>Rich Dad Poor Dad</h2>
            <h4>- Robert Kiyosaki</h4>         
            <p>The book contrasts two mindsets: employee thinking vs. owner thinking.
Poor Dad values job security and academic degrees.
Rich Dad values financial education and independence.
A salary keeps you dependent and limits wealth.
Assets create income; liabilities drain income.
The rich buy assets first, then luxuries later.
Most people reverse that and stay stuck in debt.
Financial ignorance is the real cause of money problems.
Schools never teach investing, taxes, or cash flow.
Fear of risk keeps people poor.
Employees pay the highest taxes.
Businesses and investments provide leverage and protection.
Don’t say “I can’t afford it” — ask “How can I afford it?”
Learn skills like selling and managing money.
Start small and reinvest to grow assets.
Don’t try to look rich — become rich.
Money works harder than humans ever can.
Your beliefs about money decide your future.
Financial freedom means owning your time.
Change mindset first — wealth follows.
